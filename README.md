## Coding

Here , you can find the summary of how the stack looks like , including a picture with the core thech :



* **Front-end** - Vue.js as the core framework.
                - Quasar for User Interface . 
                -Amplify for Auth UI component.
                -AWS integration
                - We use Stripe JS with Stripe Elements for card tokenizationand for validation . 
                
* **Data** - We collect all the data after GraphQL types , then we stored in DynamoDB.  
           - For the front-end , we use Typescript , Javascript. 
           - For all the services , we use Python.
           
* **API** - GraphQL is managed by AppSync .
          -  GraphQL acts as an API Hub to interact with other services.
          - Loyalty implements a REST API to demonstrate how to secure service-to-service communication while maintaining a public endpoint. 
          - Payment API is also based on REST to demonstrate an external payment provider.


* **Auth** - Cognito provides JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and along with AppSync fine-grained authorization on what data types users can access.


* **Messaging**  - Booking workflow is managed by Step Functions while SNS provides service-to-service communication through messaging between Booking and Loyalty.
